It turns out that 3(2:7^(1/3):1) - (0:1:0) - 2(1:0:1) is principal, so
3(2:7^(1/3):1) - 3(0:1:0) is equivalent to 2(1:0:1) - 2(0:1:0), which is
3-torsion.  Which means we have a 9-torsion point that explains the extra
solution.

Maybe x-coordinate is a root of x^3 + 9*x^2 + 24*x + 24. Seems to work mod 13. Not sure about what 5 or 11 is doing so maybe not. Increase precision? But not a cube so not right.

In this case, we can see that the x-coordinates of the p-adic points seem to come from a global point, alpha, which is a root of x^3 + 3*x^2 +1 = f. Then (alpha, alpha^2+2alpha) is a point on the picard curve y^3 = x^4 + x^3 - 3*x^2 - 2*x over the field Q(alpha). In other words (alpha^2 + 2 alpha)^3 is congruent to x^4 + x^3 - 3*x^2 - 2*x mod f. Note though that Q(alpha) has a prime of degree 1 above 7, 11, 13 but not 17 -- if you try at 17, then there are no extra points! For some reason this is being flagged as a torsion point (low precision?) but it's not. It's actually a third? of a rational point.

These extra unexplained points are roots of x^3+3*x+1. Again, we do the same analysis (alpha, -alpha^2-1) is a point on the curve which is defined over the number field Q(alpha). Oddly, these are the same field ... I guess the curves have the same discriminant? What is a good reason for this? (Or are there not so many fields with primes of deg 1 over 5,7,11...) Again, this point is not torsion. We had computed that it's a third? of a rational point.
